# omicFunctions

This repository contains functions that I've written to help in analysis of omic data.

I developed these for the analysis of the Solanum CO2 Total and TRAP RNA-Seq data but they are intended to be used with other data as well.

## Required R and bioconductor libraries
* tidyverse
* ggplot2
* rcolor
* rtracklayer
* GenomicRanges
* goseq
* Rsamtools
* cluster
* gplots

To do:

* Create a tutorial to use these functions, types of data structures each functions take and how to modify some variables.
* Uncouple some functions so they can be called independently if needed (ie, plotting functions.
